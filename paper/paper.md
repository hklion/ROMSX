# Summary

The Regional Model of the Ocean Refined Adaptively (REMORA) is a new implementation 
of an existing community standard ocean model, 
the Regional Ocean Modeling System 
(ROMS, [@shchepetkin.mcwilliams:05], [@haidvogel.ea:08]) that simulates estuarine and oceanic 
dynamics using the latest high-performance computing architectures.
REMORA employs hierarchical parallelism using an MPI+X model, where X may be OpenMP on
multicore CPU-only systems, or CUDA, HIP, or SYCL on GPU-accelerated systems.
It is able to be built and run in both single and double precision.
REMORA is built on AMReX [@AMReX:JOSS; @AMReX:IJHPCA],
a block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) software framework that
provides the underlying performance-portable software infrastructure for block-structured mesh operations.
REMORA, like ROMS, is a regional model, meaning that it is generally used for limited domains, 
and as such requires boundary conditions derived analytically, or from larger-scale models.

# Statement of need

Most widely used ocean modeling codes today do not have the
ability to use GPU acceleration, which limits their ability to
efficiently utilize current and next-generation high performance computing
architectures.  REMORA provides an ocean modeling capability (based on ROMS, a proven FORTRAN code
that runs efficiently on CPUs) that is able to run on all of the latest high-performance
computing architectures, from laptops to supercomputers, CPU-only or GPU-accelerated.
In addition, REMORA is based on AMReX,
a modern, well-supported adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) library,
which provides a performance portable interface that shields REMORA
from most of the detailed changes needed to adapt to new systems.
The active and large developer community contributing to AMReX helps ensure
that REMORA will continue to run efficiently as architectures and operating systems
evolve.

# REMORA Features

Like ROMS, REMORA:

 - solves the incompressible time-dependent Navier-Stokes equation with the Boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations (see [@shchepetkin.mcwilliams:05], [@haidvogel.ea:08]).
 - uses a curvilinear Arakawa C-grid.
 - uses a stretched, terrain-following vertical s-coordinate.
 - uses a split-explicit time-stepping scheme, where several fast barotropic (2D) steps take place within each baroclinic (3D) update (see [@shchepetkin.mcwilliams:05]).
 - advances baroclinic steps with a third-order Adams-Bashforth scheme.
 - advances barotropic steps with a leapfrog predictor followed by a three-time Adams-Moulton corrector.
 - advances scalars with a leapfrog step with a trapezoidal correction.
 - uses a nonlinear equation of state based on [@jackett.macdougall:97].
 - uses a third-order (U3) upwind momentum advection scheme.
 - uses U3 or center-difference, fourth-order (C4) tracer advection.
 - uses analytical vertical diffusivity or viscosity, or uses the Generic Length Scale (GLS) turbulence closure model ([@umlauf:03], [@warner:05]).
 - provides options for specified land masking, Coriolis force, and realistic wind stress.
 - uses linear, quadratic, or log-layer bottom drag.
 - uses periodic, radiation (e.g., @orlanski:76), or clamped time-varying baroclinic lateral boundary conditions.
 - uses zero-gradient, Chapman/Flather (@flather:76, @chapman:85), or clamped barotropic lateral boundary conditions.
 - uses optional boundary nudging based on @marchesiello:01.
 - supports I/O with netCDF (using PnetCDF).

Additionally, REMORA provides support for parallel I/O with AMReX plotfiles.

### Next development steps

Subsequent releases of REMORA will include:

 - parallel I/O with PnetCDF.
 - full adaptive mesh refinement; currently AMR is tested in REMORA for simple problems such as scalar advection over flat bathymetry.
 - surface heat and evaporation-precipitation flux parameterizations.
 - point sources and sinks to simulate, e.g. rivers.
 - nudging to climatology.
